About Me (Professional Bio)

I am a final-year Geomatics and Computer Science student at the University of Cape Town with a strong interest in applying spatial data, AI, and software engineering to solve real-world challenges. My academic background combines engineering-level mathematics and spatial analysis with computer science fundamentals, giving me a unique ability to bridge geospatial thinking and modern data-driven technologies.

Over the course of my studies and projects, I have gained experience in GIS platforms such as ArcGIS and QGIS, spatial data analysis, and developing machine learning models for environmental applications. For my thesis, I am working on landslide susceptibility modelling in Mexico, where I design and test AI algorithms, including neural networks, and develop a QGIS plugin to support practical geospatial workflows.

Beyond academia, I am passionate about building applications that make information more accessible. I founded Halalbites, a web platform that helps users discover halal restaurants in Cape Town, integrating APIs like Google Places, OpenStreetMap, and Mapbox. This project reflects both my technical skills in web development (Next.js, MongoDB, React) and my commitment to creating tools that provide community value.

I enjoy working at the intersection of geospatial data, AI, and software engineering, and I value collaborative, innovative environments where knowledge is shared and ideas are translated into impactful solutions.
